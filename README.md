👋 Hi, I’m @nicasalvador
👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of technology and art, diving into data analysis, and discovering new music.
🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning algorithms and improving my coding skills in Python.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to creative coding or data visualization.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to send me a message here on GitHub or reach out via email at nicasalvador@example.com.

⚡ Fun fact: I once traveled to five different countries in one month just to attend various music festivals!
